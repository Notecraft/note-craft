# Setup

```
 npm install
 run the `dev` and `ui` scripts from `package.json`
```

Todo:

- Add a mechanism to share this random pattern with others.
- View as sharps or view as flats

- Add a "pattern mode" (1,2,5) instead of (A, B, E)
- Display these notes relatively to the next notes (ala fl studio piano roll)
- Add a "last ten randomized patterns" view to the right maybe? Store in session/cookie.
- Be able to load up previous random pattern.
- Add multiple random patterns together? (String another 8 bars together)
- Multiple instruments to customize what the notes sound like.
- General style improvements
