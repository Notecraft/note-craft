# Setup

```
 npm install
 run the `dev` and `ui` scripts from `package.json`

Todo:

- Dynamic tempo calculation
- Add the rest of the modes.
- Add a key for the selected mode.
- Add a "pattern mode" (1,2,5) instead of (A, B, E)
- Add a refresh button
- General style
- Add a "last ten randomized patterns" view to the right maybe? Store in session/cookie.
- Be able to load up previous random pattern.
- Add multiple random patterns together? (String another 8 bars together)
- Multiple instruments to customize what the notes sound like.
